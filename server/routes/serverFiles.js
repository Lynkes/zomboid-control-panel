// one-call-site version of this -- getServerConfigPath()+getServerName()
// used to be two separate getActiveServer() reads, so "configPath from

// fix), but nothing made the SEPARATE call sites agree with EACH OTHER
// across one request's lifetime. getActiveServer() reads live, unlocked,
// mutable state; POST /:id/activate (routes/servers.js) mutates it under
// acquireLifecycleLock('server-profile-change', ...) -- a lock this router
// never acquires -- so a concurrent /activate is free to land in the real
// await points this file already has (this next() dispatch, the remote

// Fixed by deriving ONCE, here, in the router's EARLIEST middleware (nothing
// registered above this one derives its own -- requirePermission() at the
// top of the file doesn't touch getActiveServer() at all), and hanging the
// result on req.activeServerContext for every downstream reader -- the
// remote-mirror middleware right below, and all handlers -- to share instead
// of re-deriving. This isn't blocking a concurrent /activate (the lifecycle
// lock already does that job for what IT protects, and grabbing it here

// Ordinary edits to one of these files. The original justification for
// BLOCKING all of these outright while the server ran was the assumption
// that PZ rewrites its config files on shutdown and would discard a live
// edit — measured 2026-08-23 against a real B42 dedicated server (clean RCON
// `quit`, the same path server.js's POST /stop uses): a clean shutdown
// touches NEITHER SandboxVars.lua NOR the server .ini at all (byte-identical
// mtime/hash before and after), and the next startup rewrites both but
// PRESERVES an edit made on disk while the server was running — measured,
// not assumed. "PUT /sandbox-option" was the first removed on that evidence
// alone (a stuck-forever refusal was a real, reported bug).
//
// For these remaining nine, the operator has since RULED (2026-08-23, his
// own knowledge of the game, not derived from the measurement above): edits
// are always allowed while the server runs; a write just does not reach the
// live game until the next restart. That ruling is what changed the
// behavior below from "refuse" to "allow and say so" — the measurement only
// established that a clean shutdown/startup cycle doesn't lose the edit,
// which is necessary for the ruling to be safe but isn't by itself a claim
// about every route below applying live or requiring a restart uniformly.
// See warnRunningForLocalConfigEdit() in configMutationGuard.js for the
// mechanism, and each handler's own response for where restartRequired is
// attached.
//
// HONEST CAVEAT for whoever reads this next: the measurement covers a B42
// server only, both a clean RCON `quit` and a hard `taskkill /F` force-stop
// (dwight, 2026-08-23, replicating serverManager.stopServer()'s actual
// mechanism) — both behave identically for this question: neither rewrites
// either file, both preserve an edit made on disk while running, and
// startup afterward rewrites-but-preserves in both cases. Two things remain
// genuinely untested: a B41 server (no B41 dedicated-server install was
// available to test against), and whether a kill landing mid-write could
// corrupt an in-flight write specifically (no write was ever caught in
// flight in either session, clean or forced). The operator's ruling covers
// all of this from his own experience running these servers and outranks
// one narrow experiment — but it IS judgement layered on top of
// measurement, not measurement alone, and the two should stay

// so every log line that quotes a request header or unauthenticated input
// escapes it the same way.
//
// A CR/LF in such a value used to start a new line in combined.log -- the
// file support bundles ship -- that nobody could tell from a real panel
// entry. Node's HTTP parser refuses CR/LF in a header, but it accepts bytes
// 0x80-0xFF and hands them over as latin1, so 0x85 arrives as U+0085 (NEL),
// which some log viewers also break lines on, as they do on U+2028/U+2029.
// Every C0 control character, DEL, every C1 control character and
// U+2028/U+2029 is escaped to a visible \n / \r / \t / \uXXXX, so one value
// can never be more than its own part of one line.
// Built from code points: a literal U+2028/U+2029 in the source is invisible.

// Config reads and writes (<name>.ini, the .lua files, their .bak backups,
// templates). It was saved with no check at all, so servers.manage alone
// (technician) could point it at any folder on this computer, then list it,
// fetch images from it and write .ini/.lua files into it through
// /api/server-files. Every flow that sets it (detect, auto-scan, both
// install routes) sends <zomboidDataPath>/Server, so a value is accepted
// only when it resolves, links followed, to that folder or one inside it.
// The server's own data folder is the anchor, so one is required. The value
// is checked as typed (no %VAR% expansion, unlike zomboidDataPath), so
// nothing about the environment can be read back through this check.
//
// routes/servers.js applies it when the folder is saved; routes/
// serverFiles.js applies it again when the folder is used, so one saved
// before the check existed is refused there too.

// records from naming a config folder outside their data folder, but a
// record saved before it -- or one with a config folder and no data folder,
// or the legacy settings copy -- still reached every reader that took
// serverConfigPath as it was: Server Files' gate held a record to the rule
// only when it had both folders, and the other readers never did. Every
// reader that reads or writes a server's .ini/.lua files now goes through
// serverConfigDirOf() or activeServerConfigDir() below (or the check above,
// directly), so they agree on which folder that is:
//   - a config folder that is named is used only while it is inside
//     <dataPath>/Server; otherwise it is refused, never swapped for another
//     folder (the operator would be editing files they didn't pick);
//   - with none named, <dataPath>/Server, as before.

// SECURITY (2026-10-05, PATHS-1/PATHS-2 verifier pass 2): holding the
// config folder to <dataPath>/Server protects nothing while the data folder
// itself goes unjudged -- and a remote server's never is when it is saved
// (its path names a folder on its own host), nor is the legacy settings
// copy setActiveServer() made of one. So a technician saved a remote server
// whose data folder was any folder here, and the mods routes,
// /configure-rcon, /configure-network and the UPnP edit read and rewrote
// <that folder>/Server/<name>.ini on this computer. The data folder in
// effect is now held to the data-folder rule (services/zomboidDataPath.js)
// here, where every one of those readers and writers resolves the folder:
// refused (`reason: "data-folder"`), there is no config folder. A
// same-host "remote" profile whose data folder is a real one keeps working,
// and one on another host names a path that isn't here (nothing to judge).

// 2026-09-04, lifecycle-lock investigation: the lock itself was never the
// problem -- every acquire/release path was already correct, and the
// process-wide scope is intentional (an auto-update must not run while
// someone clicks Start on any server; a per-server lock would not prevent
// that). The actual defect was the REFUSAL MESSAGE: "Another server
// lifecycle operation is already in progress" names neither the operation
// nor the server holding the lock, so even an engineer who had just
// instrumented this exact code path read a correct 409 as a probable leak.
//
// 2026-09-08, normalize-lifecycle-lock-server-identifier: renamed from
// `serverName` to `serverId` and its contract narrowed on purpose. The old
// name invited five different values across the 20 real call sites (display
// name, server DB id, a Docker container id, a save name, or nothing) to
// share one field -- harmless while it was purely cosmetic for the 409
// message below, but it means a same-server EQUALITY COMPARISON between two
// callers' values is meaningless without first knowing which of the five
// schemes each one used. `serverId` is now always the server's DB id (the
// same value getActiveServer()/getServer() return as `.id`) or null when a
// site genuinely has no server to name yet (see server.js's /delete-files:
// the lock there is deliberately acquired before its target path is even
// parsed, so there is no id to pass without reopening the exact TOCTOU
// window the lock exists to close). Still optional and still just carried
// through to the 409 message below -- it changes nothing about who holds
// the lock or how it's released -- but a caller can no longer paper over
// "I don't have the id" by passing a display name instead, which is the
// property the eventual same-server SteamCMD guard needs.

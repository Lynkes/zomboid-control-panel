/**
 * Authentication Service
 * Handles user registration, login, JWT tokens, and session management.
 *
 * Design:
 * - bcryptjs for password hashing (pure JS, compatible with pkg)
 * - JWT access tokens (short-lived, 15m) + refresh tokens (long-lived, 30d)
 * - Auto-login via refresh token stored in httpOnly cookie
 * - First-run setup creates the admin account
 * - JWT secret: JWT_SECRET / JWT_SECRET_FILE env override if set (an
 *   operator-pinned value, e.g. a Docker/K8s secret mount, or to share one
 *   key across multiple panel instances behind a load balancer), otherwise
 *   auto-generated once and persisted at <dataDir>/jwt.secret -- NOT in
 *   db.json. See utils/jwtSecret.js for why it moved out: db.json is
 *   copied wholesale by two backup paths (the automatic rotation ring and
 *   the opt-in "include DB" game-backup zip), so a signing key kept there
 *   would ride along in both.
 *
 * 2026-08-29 (auth/sessions hunt, hunt-wave7): two things in the Design
 * block above were stale, found in two passes, not one.
 *
 * FIRST PASS fixed only the line I was explicitly told about: access
 * tokens used to be 24h, and this comment already called that
 * "short-lived" -- it never was. An access token can't be individually
 * revoked (logout only revokes the refresh SESSION, see logout() below;
 * authenticateAccessToken() only ever checks tokenGen, which logout
 * doesn't touch), so 24h was the real size of the "logout doesn't
 * actually log you out" window. 15m is anchored to two measured, real
 * properties of this app, not a round number that felt safe: (1)
 * client/src/lib/api.ts already does transparent, deduped refresh-on-401
 * (one extra round trip, replayed once, safe even for mutations since the
 * server rejects the original request first) -- the machinery that makes
 * a short TTL free was already built and working, so shortening this
 * completes a design that was three-quarters there rather than trading UX
 * for security; (2) the client's own busiest legitimate polling interval
 * observed in this codebase is 5s (ServerConfig.tsx), with most pages in
 * the 10-30s range -- 15m is roughly two orders of magnitude above every
 * one of them, so active use essentially never re-triggers a refresh more
 * than once per TTL window, not once per poll.
 *
 * SECOND PASS, after being asked to re-check the rest of the SAME block
 * rather than trust that fixing the one named line meant it was clean:
 * the "stored in db.json" line was ALSO stale -- pointed at a location
 * this service moved away from specifically for a security reason (see
 * utils/jwtSecret.js: db.json is copied wholesale by two backup paths, so
 * a signing key kept there would ride along in both), which made it
 * actively misleading to anyone reasoning about backups/restores, not
 * merely out of date. A named fix is a searchlight -- it lights one spot
 * and leaves its neighbors dark unless you deliberately read past the
 * edge of what was pointed at.

// Confirmed live: an unauthenticated POST /api/auth/users with
// role:"admin" created a real admin account on a fully set-up install.
// /api/auth/oidc/status, /login and /callback are the ONLY OIDC paths in

// nothing under it would ever need a gate — that stopped being true the

   * holds every capability, so the escalation check never refuses them)
   * could still move themselves to a different role with zero cooperation,
   * exactly the one-click-accident shape deleteUser's own comment already
   * rejected for account deletion.
   *
   * Escalation: refuses assigning ANYONE — self or otherwise — a role whose
   * capabilities aren't a subset of the caller's own
   * (assertNoCapabilityEscalation above). This is the check that stops a
   * users.manage-only caller promoting a DIFFERENT account to admin, which
   * the self-change block above has nothing to say about.
   *
